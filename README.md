# Foundry model

This repository is the part of the material science research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Spring 2021 under Professor Dane Morgan's revision. We are exploring on how can we use machine learning models to predict the chemical properties of the molecules.

We work on [QM9 dataset](http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/) which provides quantum chemical properties for small organic molecules and explore [MXM Net model](https://github.com/zetayue/MXMNet) current state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network (GNN) model on predicting formation energy.
